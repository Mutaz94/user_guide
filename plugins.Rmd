## CXX11

__Purpose__

Compile your model file with `C++11` standard.

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGINS CXX11
```

## Rcpp

__Purpose__

Link to `Rcpp` headers into your model.

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGINS Rcpp
```

Note that once your model is linked to `Rcpp`, you can start using that 
functionality immediately (without including `Rcpp.h`).

## Rcpp

__Purpose__

Link to `RcppArmadillo` headers into your model.

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGINS RcppArmadillo
```



## BH

__Purpose__

Link to `boost` headers into your model.

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGINS BH
```

Note that once your model is linked to `BH` (`boost`), you will be able to 
include the `boost` header file that you need. You have to include the header
file that contains the `boost` function you want to use.
