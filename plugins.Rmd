# Plugins {#plugins}

## tad

__Purpose__
Advanced calculation time after dose within your model. We call this "advanced"
because it lets you track doses in multiple compartments. See the note below 
about a simpler way to calculate time after dose that should work fine if doses
are only in a single compartment. This functionality is provided by mrgsolve. 

__Usage__

First, tell `mrgsolve` that you want to use the `tad` plugin

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGIN tad
```


__Note__
Note there is a simpler way to calculate time after dose when only dosing into
a single compartment

```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ main ]

double tad = self.tad();
```

The `self` object (Section \@ref(self-tad)) contains a `tad()` member which 
will track time after dose. Note that this needs to be called every record. 


## CXX11  {#plugin-cxx11}

__Purpose__

Compile your model file with `C++11` standard.

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGIN CXX11
```

## Rcpp

__Purpose__

Link to `Rcpp` headers into your model.

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGIN Rcpp
```

Note that once your model is linked to `Rcpp`, you can start using that 
functionality immediately (without including `Rcpp.h`).

Information about `Rcpp` can be found here: https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

## Rcpp

__Purpose__

Link to `RcppArmadillo` headers into your model. 

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGIN RcppArmadillo
```

Information about `armadillo` can be found here: http://arma.sourceforge.net/

## BH

__Purpose__

Link to `boost` headers into your model. 

__Usage__ 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PLUGIN BH
```

Note that once your model is linked to `BH` (`boost`), you will be able to 
include the `boost` header file that you need. You have to include the header
file that contains the `boost` function you want to use.

Information about `boost` can be found here: https://boost.org. Information
