# Questions and Answers {#q-and-a}

I'm using this chapter as a place to provide miscellaneous information that 
might not have an obvious place to live. I'd call this a FAQ, but not all of 
the questions are asked frequently or at all. 

## Can I interrupt a simulation?

Starting with `mrgsolve` version `0.11.1`, you can interrupt a long simulation
by pressing `Control-C` or `Esc`, the standard way to pass an interrupt signal
through R. `mrgsolve` will stop every so often to look for the interrupt 
signal.  

You can control the frequency with which `mrgsolve` looks for the interrupt 
signal through an argument to `mrgsim` (default: 256 simulation records).
Increase to check less frequently, increase to check more frequently (this might
be needed for a model where a large amount of work is required to advance
one step) or set to negative number to never check.
