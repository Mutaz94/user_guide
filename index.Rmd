# Introduction {-}
<img src="images/mrgsolve_hex.png" align="right" width="150px"></img> Welcome to
the mrgsolve user guide. The user guide is the main documentation source for how
mrgsolve works and how to best use mrgsolve in your modeling and simulation
project.  As with most of the mrgsolve documentation, this is a work in
progress.  I am currently working to transition this to more of a reference
resource, rather than demonstration.  So key content in the user guide includes
chapter \@ref(model-specification) on model specification, chapter
\@ref(model-components) on model components and chapter \@ref(section-sequence)
on the simulation sequence. Installation is a big topic but we defer to the wiki
page for installation help since requirements tend to change frequently with new
R releases.  The other content is hopefully helpful as well.  I'm leaving it all
in place for now, but will gradually transition the "how-to" and demo type
content over to the vignettes repository or the gallery repository (see
[below](#other-resources)).

Please feel free to ask questions about anything mrgsolve-related on the 
issue tracker on the main github repo: https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/issues.
