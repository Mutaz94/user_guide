# Simulation sequence {#section-sequence}

This section is intended to help the user understand
the steps `mrgsolve` takes when working through 
a simulation problem.  The focus is on the order
in which `mrgsolve` calls different user-defined
functions as well as when parameter updates
and output writing happens during the simulation
sequence. 

## Functions to call
The model specification results in the definition
of four functions that `mrgsolve` calls during the 
simulation sequence.  Naming them by 
their code block identifiers, the functions are

1. `$PREAMBLE`
1. `$MAIN`
1. `$ODE`
1. `$TABLE`

## Problem initiation
Just prior to starting the problem (when `NEWIND` is 
equal to `0`), `mrgsolve` calls `$PREAMBLE`.  This function is only called once during the simulation 
sequence.  The goal of `$PREAMBLE` is to allow
the user to work with different `C++` data structures to get them ready for the simulation run. 

## Subject initiation
After the `$PREAMBLE` call, `mrgsolve` simulates
each `ID` in the data set, one after another.  `mrgsolve` runs this sequence just prior to simulating a given `ID`

1. Copy any parameters that are found in the `idata_set` to the working parameter list
1. Copy any parameters that are found in 
the `data_set` to the working parameter list, 
with the copy being taken from the first actual
data set row for that individual.  If the 
first actual data set record in the data set
is not the first record for the individual, 
`mrgsolve` still copies from the first data 
set record as long as the `fillbak` argument
to `mrgsim` is `TRUE`. 
1. Set initial estimates from the base 
initial estimate list
1. Copy initial estimates from `idata_set` if they
are found there.
1. Call `$MAIN`
1. Start simulating the records for that individual

## Sequence for a single record
`mrgsolve` executes this sequence while working 
from record to record for a given `ID`

1. If `nocb` (next observation carried backward) is `TRUE`, then parameters are  copied from the current record if that is an actual data set record. Note that if `nocb` is `FALSE` then `locf` (first observation carried forward) is assumed to be `TRUE`
(see below).
1. `$MAIN` is called
1. The system is advanced via `$ODE` or `$PKMODEL`, 
whichever one is invoked in the model specification
file. 
1. If the current record is a dosing record, 
the dose is implemented (e.g. bolus made or 
infusion started). 
1. If the system is advancing according to 
`locf`, then parameters are copied from
the current record if that is an actual data set
record. This is in contrast to `nocb` advance (see
above).
1. The `$TABLE` function is called
1. If the current record is marked for inclusion 
in the simulated output, results are 
written to the output matrix.
1. Continue to the next record in the individual.
1. Once the last record is processed in an 
individual, a new individual is started.
